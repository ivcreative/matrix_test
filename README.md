# FED Test for Matrix Group
## Description 

The two main art boards in the design represent 1 web page - the `articles` and `events` buttons are expected to toggle content.

You may use any CSS/Javascript framework or none at all. 

Please code this in one browser - we want you to complete as much of the design as possible and don't want you to spend time troubleshooting the display in various browsers.
